# Sticky-MenuBar-Web-Project
This project demonstrates a sticky navigation bar using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes a centered logo and a horizontal menu with links (Home, Services, Blog, About Us, Contact). On scrolling, the menu bar becomes fixed at the top, providing easy access to navigation and enhancing user experience with a clean layout.
